# Binary-Trees

Compilation: g++  -Wall main.cpp tree.cpp -o tree
usage: tree <amount of starting nodes>
  Starting nodes should be between 0 and 20

Tests performed in main function:

Adds an amount of nodes to the tree as specified by the user in the command line. All id for nodes are unique.

Performs an inorder traversal of tree

Checks to see if tree is empty (should return false)

Add 6 more nodes and print height of tree after adding each node

Print size of tree

Print inorder traversal of tree

Checks to see if certain nodes exist in tree (first if node 8 exists and then node 12)

Removes a node (9) and then checks to see if it exists

Prints post order traversal of tree

prints preorder traversal of tree

Returns value node 3 from tree
